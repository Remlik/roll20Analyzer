How to add tags to my game:
    There are 3 types of tag single Tags, timed tags, and indefinite tags
    Tags must be typed into the roll20 chat as the game is played as an emote
    The tag name must be a single word
    The tag Name must have a ^ before the name as in ^tagNameSingle tags only tag then next roll with given tag
    example:
        /em ^swordAtk (This will make the next roll be tagged with SwordAtk)

    Time tags will tag everything with the tag for the number of min/hours given
    example:
        /em ^wizTower -5h (All rolls for the next 5 hours will be tagged with wizTower)
        /em ^darkCave -30m (All rolls for the next 30 min will be tagged with darkCave)

    Indefinite tags will everything with the tag until told to stop
    example:
    /em ^underDark -start (All rolls will be tagged with underDark until told to spop)

    all of these tags can be given the self modifier to make the only apply to the next person who rolls
    example:
        /em ^wizTower -5h -self (All roll by the next person who rolls will be tagged with wizTower for the next 5 hours)
        /em ^dawfFort -start -self (All roll by the next person who rolls will be tagged with dawfFort until told to stop)
    The above examples can be the can also be written like this /em ^wizTower -self -5h or /em ^dawfFort -self -start

    Ending tags
    there are 2 way to end a tag the -end and -endall
    -end will stop all indefinite or timed tag early with the tag name given
    any player a can end any tag, having a self modifier does not stop another player from ending a tag
    example:
        /em ^wizTower -end
        /em ^underDark -end
    -endall will stop all tags
    example:
        /em ^end -endall (This will end all current active tags)
